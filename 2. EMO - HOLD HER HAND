Hold her, I want to hold her hand, I want to hold her down, I want to hold her down.
I want to mac her down, as I mac her down, Smackin Cheeks, as I'm minding mine.

0:22 - 0:44
Jennifer I want to mac you down, as I mac you down, to make you mine.
Don't go think you're mud, go Ann think you're mud, because I think of you as much as I think of mud.
I'm to make you mind, I'm not here to take your mind, I'm not here to take your mind, I'm not here to take your mind.
I'm here to make your mind, I'm here make your mind, I'm here to make your mind, I'm here to make your mind.   
0:45 - 0:55
Jeniffer if you're not in love with me, then I'm not in love with you, then I'm in love with you.
Jeniffer if you're in love with me, then I'm in love with her, then I'm in love with her.

Take her out, I wanted to take her to town, take her out, I'll never get to take her out.  
I wanted to taste her out, I waned to taste her out, I'll never get to taste her out, get to ever taste her out. 
Lotus flower, don't you cry, because I think of you as much as I think of mud.
Got to make you mine, never got to mac you mine, as I made you in mud, made you in mud.
