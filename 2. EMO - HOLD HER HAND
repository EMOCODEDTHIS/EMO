PG 3 Lyric 

0:00 - 0:10
Hold her, I wanted to hold her hand, I don't get to hold her hand, I don't get to hold her hand.
I wanted to make her mine, mac her mine. Mac n Cheese, macking mine. 
0:11 - 0:21
0:22 - 0:44
Jennifer I wanted to mac you down, as I mac you down, to make you mine.
Don't change your mind, don't go Ann change your mind, don't go Ann change your mind, don't go Ann change your mind. 
I'm to make you mine, I'm here to make you mine, I'm not here to take your mind, take your mind.
I'm here to make you mind, I'm to make you mind, I'm here to save you time, not waste your time. 
0:45 - 0:55
Jeniffer if you're in love with me, then I'm in love with you.
Jeniffer if you're in love with me, then I'm in love with you.
0:56 - 1:06
1:07 - 1:29
Take her out, I wanted to take her to town, take her out, I'll never get to take her out.  
I wanted to taste her out, I wanted to taste her out, I'll never get to taste her out, get to ever taste her out. 
Lotus flower, don't you cry, because I never tasted you, tasted you, tasted you out.
Got to make you mine, never got to mac you mine, mac you mine, mac you mine.

1:07 - 1:29
Hold her hand, I don't want to hold her hand, I want to take her mind, I want to make her mud.
I wanted to make her mine, mac her mine. Mac n Cheese, minding mine. 
Lotus flower, lotus flower, don't you cry, don't you cry
I wanted to make her mine, mac her mine. Mac n Cheese, macking mine.
